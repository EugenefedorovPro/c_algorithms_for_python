| Merge Sort       | Divides the array, recursively sorts, and merges subarrays          | O(n log n) / O(n log n) / O(n log n) | O(n)             | Large datasets, external sorting, situations where stability is important (preserves relative order of equal elements).                       | High                                                         |

| Heap Sort        | Builds a binary heap and extracts the maximum/minimum element       | O(n log n) / O(n log n) / O(n log n) | O(1)             | Sorting large datasets in limited memory, useful in systems with fixed memory constraints.                                                    | Medium                                                       |
| Radix Sort       | Sorts numbers digit by digit using another sorting algorithm (e.g., counting sort) | O(nk) / O(nk) / O(nk) | O(n + k)         | Sorting integers or strings, works well when sorting data with a known range or fixed-length keys (e.g., integers, dates, etc.).              | Medium                                                       |
| Counting Sort    | Counts occurrences of each element, places them in sorted order     | O(n + k) / O(n + k) / O(n + k)       | O(k)             | Suitable for sorting integers or objects with a limited range of values, like exam scores, or datasets where elements are repeated.           | Low                                                          |
